## GAME GOAL
Players travel into the world of dreams, where unusual lands await them. Some are like fairy tales, others are dark and full of ravens.
**The goal of the game is to create a dream with as few ravens as possible.**

---

## GAME SETUP
1. **Dealing:** Shuffle all the cards thoroughly. Each player takes 4 cards and does **not** look at them.
2. **Player’s Dream:** Place the 4 cards face-down on the table in front of you – these 4 cards form the player’s dream.
    > **Important!** Make sure no one reveals their cards during dealing. Players cannot know what cards they have.
3. **Face-down deck:** From the remaining cards, create a face-down deck and place it in the center of the table.
4. **Face-up pile:** Take the top card from the face-down deck and place it next to it, face-up.

**Layout of cards on the table:**
* Cards forming the player’s dream are always face-down.
* Cards in the face-down deck stay face-down.
* Cards in the face-up pile are always face-up.

## GAMEPLAY

### Introduction
The player who had the strangest dream last night begins (or the oldest player).
Before the game starts, each player may look at 2 lands in their dream. They may choose any 2 of the 4 cards in front of them. After peeking, they put them back (still face-down).
> Players therefore know 2 lands in their dream, while the other 2 remain unknown.

### Player Turn
On their turn, a player may perform one of two actions:

#### A. Taking a land from the face-up pile
The player takes the land from the face-up pile and exchanges it with one from their dream.
* They can replace a land they don’t like (too many ravens).
* They can take a risk and replace one of the two unknown lands.
* The swapped-out land is placed on the face-up pile face-up.

#### B. Taking a land from the face-down deck
The player draws a land (hidden from the others) and chooses one of the following:
1. **B1. Swap:** Swap it with one land from their dream. The swapped-out card goes to the face-up pile.
2. **B2. Discard:** Place it on the face-up pile (if they don’t want it).
3. **B3. Special effect:** If the card is a special land, they may use its effect.
    * If they want to use the effect: they place the card on the face-up pile and perform the action.
    * If not: treat it as a normal card (see B1, B2).

---

## SPECIAL LANDS
> **Note!** Special effects can only be used when the land was taken from the **face-down deck**. If taken from the face-up pile, the effect cannot be used.

* **Take 2 (Value 5):** The player draws 2 lands from the top of the face-down deck. They choose one of them (the other is placed on the face-up pile) and perform one of the normal actions (add to dream, discard, or use its effect if it is also special).
* **Peek 1 (Value 6):** The player may look at 1 land from any player’s dream (including their own), then place it back in the same spot.
* **Swap 2 (Value 7):** The player swaps 2 lands in the dreams of any players, without revealing them. One of them may be from their own dream.

---

## END OF ROUND
A round can end in two moments:
* **When the face-down deck runs out** (a rare case).
* When a player believes their dream has the fewest ravens and, at the start of their turn, says **WAKE UP!**

* The player who says “WAKE UP!” performs no action that turn.
* Everyone reveals their dreams and counts ravens.

**Resolution:**
1. If the player who called wake-up has the **fewest** ravens (or ties): their score equals the sum of ravens on their cards.
2. If they **do not** have the fewest ravens: they add **5 ravens** to their score as a penalty.
    * *Risky variant:* You may agree on a 15-raven penalty.

**Starting the Next Round:**
Players record their scores. All cards (dreams, face-up pile, face-down deck) are collected and shuffled. Players receive 4 new cards face-down to form their new dream, following the **GAME SETUP** procedure. The player sitting to the left of the one who ended the previous round begins the new round.

---

## END OF GAME
The game ends when any player reaches (or exceeds) **100 ravens**.
The winner is the player with the fewest ravens.
* You may set a different point limit (e.g., 70 or 150) or a fixed number of rounds.
