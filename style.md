# Style Guide

Sen is a dreamy, atmospheric card game where players navigate a mystical world of crows and cards. The game combines strategic gameplay with an ethereal visual experience that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly.

## Visual Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Warm Cream Base**: Soft beige/cream background (hsl 40, 25%, 92%) creating a dreamy, nostalgic foundation
- **Muted Purple Primary**: Gentle purple accents (hsl 280, 30%, 50%) for interactive elements and CTAs
- **Soft Teal Secondary**: Calm cyan tones (hsl 180, 25%, 60%) for secondary actions and highlights
- **Warm Burgundy**: Rich red (hsl 355, 45%, 45%) for destructive actions and special game moves
- **Amber/Gold**: Warm golden tones for cards, values, and special highlights

### Typography
- **Headings**: "Lora" serif font for a classic, storybook feel
- **Body**: "Inter" sans-serif for clean, readable UI text
- **Card Numbers**: Bold, heavy weight with strong shadows for visibility

### Visual Effects & Animation
- **Dreamy Glow Effects**: Multi-layered shadows with purple/amber tints creating magical auras
- **Smooth Transitions**: 200ms cubic-bezier easing on all interactive elements
- **Floating Elements**: Subtle float animations (6s ease-in-out) on background elements
- **3D Card Flips**: Perspective-based card rotations with realistic timing
- **Flying Crows**: Animated SVG crows crossing the screen for atmospheric movement

### Component Styling
- **Cards**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, gradient overlays, and special card indicators
- **Buttons**: Soft shadows with hover states, primary purple with cream text
- **Backgrounds**: Subtle noise texture overlay, gradient overlays, and frosted glass effects
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons with consistent sizing and color treatment

### Layout Patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with breakpoints at sm:, md:, lg:
- **Card Grids**: Flexible layouts with proper spacing and aspect ratios
- **Side Panels**: Frosted glass backdrop-blur effects for overlays
- **Game Board**: Background image with overlay for text readability

### Special Effects
- **Glow States**: Golden, purple, and cyan glows for different game states
- **Shimmer Effects**: Animated gradient overlays for loading states
- **Dreamy Shadows**: Multi-layered shadows with purple/amber color mixing
- **Backdrop Blur**: 12px blur with saturation for glass morphism effects

The overall aesthetic creates a cozy, magical atmosphere that feels like playing cards in a dream - warm, inviting, and slightly mysterious with its floating crows and soft glowing elements.
